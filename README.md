# EtherCV

Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum network or a testnet such as Kovan or Ropsten.

Add your information by interacting with the contract where each piece of information added will become a transaction.

There are other ways to expand upon this such as populating the information with a migration contract or script.

Feel free to add to this as you please.
